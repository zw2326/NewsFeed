Even in the age of Trump, Europe still takes its cues from America | Natalie Nougayrède
Yes, French and US feminists are different. But talk of a gulf between our continents is overdoneEurope's Americanisation is ongoing. That may well sound paradoxical. So many transatlantic gaps have appeared in the age of Trump. This American president repels many Europeans, and in unprecedented ways. Many on the old continent seek solace in the contrast: perhaps Europe's hour could be on the horizon? But it's striking how European debates on issues such as racism and feminism are now so strongly influenced by movements across the Atlantic. In the realm of ideas and campaigning, Europe and the US are drawing closer, not sliding further apart.

The Guardian view on Trump's non-visit: social media beats diplomacy | Editorial
The president's decision not to come to open the new US embassy begs the question – in an age of terror, are diplomats still necessary?The reason why President Trump called off his visit to London to open the new US embassy may never be clear. It might be wise not to overthink it; he probably didn't. Perhaps it was the threat of hostile demonstrations, or maybe a sign of the low priority he gives to a working lunch with Theresa May. Or it could even have been, as the president himself tweeted late on Thursday night, because the real estate magnate in him reckoned it was a&nbsp;bad decision to replace the "best located and finest embassy in London" with an "off location" address – a decision he wrongly&nbsp;blamed on President Obama.In fact, the move was decided in the Bush era, partly because Grosvenor Square had been outgrown, and partly because its swanky Mayfair location fell well short of the extreme security demanded of US embassies after a series of terror attacks. But, unwittingly, the president has drawn attention to a different question: whether embassies are still needed at all. When a Skype call can be set up in seconds, communication is instant and secure, and keeping up with social media reveals intelligence even the best-placed diplomat might miss, why spend billions of dollars setting up a target for terrorists?

Ben Rhodes: 'Obama has a serenity that I don't. I get more exercised'
He spent 10 years as Barack Obama's right-hand man. As a new film puts him in the spotlight, he talks high-stakes diplomacy and the chaos of Trump's White HouseIn his final foreign speech as president, Barack Obama spoke to a crowd in Athens. "As you may have noticed," he said, "the next American president and I could not be more different. But American democracy is bigger than any one person." More than a year on, with that proposition tested daily, Obama's decision to make his last trip abroad to the birthplace of western democracy looks prescient.The person Obama turned to just before taking the stage was a trim man with thin, close-cropped hair and a furrowed brow who had been at his side on almost every foreign trip he made, and who helped write this and just about every other foreign policy speech the president delivered. Ben Rhodes, the longest-serving member of Obama's foreign policy team, at the age of 40, has been a permanent fixture in his close orbit; inside the Obama camp, Rhodes was routinely said to be so close to the president that their minds had melded.

Succeeding Donald Trump as US president would be an incredible climax to a true rags to riches life story that fostered her trademark compassionOprah Winfrey was four-and-a-half years old, maybe five, when she decided she wasn't going to have the life expected of her. She was raised on a small Mississippi farm by her grandmother, whose highest hope for her granddaughter was that when she became someone's domestic worker, she would be treated kindly by her employers. "I just hope you get some good white folks when you grow up, treat you right, treat you nice," Winfrey said her grandmother told her.This week, there has been fevered speculation that Winfrey might run for president of the US. And that she might win – one poll found 48% of US voters would choose Winfrey, with 38% voting for Trump. Continue reading...

California in revolt: how the progressive state plans to foil the Trump agenda
From immigration to the environment and recreational cannabis, state leaders and activists are finding paths to circumvent the administration. Will it work? California prides itself on being first with progressive laws on climate change, labor rights and marijuana. In 2018, the Golden State's "firsts" are defensive – bold proposals and legal maneuvers to protect citizens from Donald Trump.State leaders have pushed legislation and lawsuits to circumvent and undo Trump's agenda on immigration, the environment, internet freedom and other liberal causes. One of the most consequential victories came Tuesday when a judge in San Francisco blocked the Trump administration's plan to end a program that allows 800,000 undocumented people to study and work in the US.

Why is the cover of Fire and Fury so ugly?
The bestselling Donald Trump exposé has a startlingly bald, plain cover – but that is in keeping with the no-frills conventions of the politics genreDonald Trump and subtlety do not go together naturally, but the cover of Michael Wolff's bestselling White House exposé Fire and Fury greets the gaze like a towel-snap to the face: shouty, red capitals over a shouty, red man. While the red, white and blue cover is certainly eye-catching, its design has been criticised as too bland and simplistic for a book that has had such an explosive impact. "Why did they have to make the Fire and Fury book cover on Microsoft Word?" reads one derisive Twitter take, while a design website gave it faint praise for echoing "the raw immediacy and faux-outsider aesthetics that underlined Trump's entire campaign".After he was approached by "some folks who think the existing cover is a disaster and a missed opportunity", designer Edel Rodriguez (who made two striking Trump covers for Time magazine) came up with a new cover for Wolff's book. His bright and bold design, featuring a fiery Trump looming over a tiny White House, is now being celebrated as the cover that should have been, with some readers even downloading it to replace the original on their e-readers.
